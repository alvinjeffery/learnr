## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Load Support Data

```{r load_data, echo=TRUE}
getHdata(support) # loading data
w <- select(support, age, death, dzgroup, bili)
head(w)
```

## Logistic Regression

```{r analysis, eval=TRUE}
# f <- glm(death ~ age + bili, data=w, family='binomial')
# summary(f)

f <- lrm(death ~ rcs(age, 3) + rcs(bili, 3), data=w)
f

```

# learnr

The resources on this page are intended for clinician scientists who want to learn R.  Clinicians (i.e., nurses, physicians, psychologists, etc.) have an educational background and work experience that doesn't typically include programming knowledge.  Therefore, I started a workshop that is a more gentle introduction into R that uses terminology and examples more familiar to clinicians.  By using healthcare examples and working as a group, I expect learners will more quickly conquer R's steep learning curve.  Ultimately, I hope clinicians become more efficient in their scholarly work and have a greater appreciation for what's possible with informatics and statistics.
